<h5>I</h5>


<p>Once in a generation an author surpasses the bounds of nationality.
Of such cosmopolitan artists Maurice Maeterlinck is perhaps the most
shining example. Twenty years ago I was vainly endeavouring to interest
English publishers in his plays. To-day I am asked to produce a version
of one of his earlier and less familiar works, because the time is
approaching for that monument to his fame which so few writers enjoy
in their lifetime&mdash;namely, the complete edition. He is not a Belgian
writer merely or chiefly; above all he is an English, an American
author. His readers in England and the United States far outnumber
those who read the original French. His books are published in England
and America almost as soon as they appear in France and Belgium, and
in at least one case the English publication was the earlier. More and
more do his lovers demand every word that his pen has formed. Sooner or
later, therefore, it was inevitable that these "Poems" should appear in
translation.</p>



<h5>II</h5>


<p>The poems contained in this volume form part of a movement long
defunct&mdash;the Belgian Symbolist movement, an offshoot of that Belgian
renascence which produced so remarkable a body of great and noble
poetry. I cannot say, however, that perusal of the other poets of
the period will assist the reader to appreciate the volume in hand.
Eekhoud, Elskamp, Gilkin, Rodenbach, Verhaeren&mdash;none of these wrote
verse which could possibly be confounded with that of Maeterlinck;
twenty years ago the latter was no less original than he is to-day.</p>

<p>Many poets of the late nineteenth century were, without being
symbolists, affected by the Symbolist movement&mdash;a movement very loosely
named, since the actual symbolists connected with it could be counted
on the fingers of one hand. More particularly were they influenced by
the tendency to put music before matter, beauty before sense, which is
expressed by the so familiar lines of Verlaine:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15%;">
De la musique avant toute chose,<br />
Et pour cela préfère l'Impair,<br />
Plus vague et plus soluble dans l'air,<br />
Sans rien en lui qui pèse ou pose...<br />
De la musique encor et toujours!<br />
</p>

<p>But musical as Maeterlinck's verses are, and rich in sheer beauty,
we are very seldom in doubt as to what the poet says, however little
we may in some cases understand what he means. His statements are
concrete and lucid; it is the inner meaning, the soul of his verse,
that sometimes threatens to elude us. Had this volume been cast upon
the late Victorian world this preface would perhaps have been longer.
But I cannot believe that these poems will present any difficulties
to a generation which has degustated such phenomena as Cubism and its
kindred manifestations.</p>



<h5>III</h5>


<p>It is safe to assert that the writer of these poems had read his
Verlaine, his Rimbaud, his Mallarmé, and his Baudelaire, and of
English-speaking poets Emerson, Poe, perhaps Rossetti, and above all
Whitman. But he is no disciple; and his essential originality, and the
keynote of his aesthetics, is a system of symbolism.</p>

<p>Now here at once we are on dangerous ground. When a poet makes use of
a symbol it is because that symbol enables him to say something that
he cannot say so well, or so beautifully, or perhaps at all, in plain
language. He is a rash man, therefore, who will attempt to elucidate
another's symbolism. However, I have already been rash, in venturing
to translate, not a few selected lyrics, but an entire volume of verse
from cover to cover, than which there is no more appalling task in
literature. But I am not, therefore, disposed to court disaster by
attempting any detailed or positive explanation. I could indeed have
asked M. Maeterlinck for such; but at the moment of writing his country
is being crucified by the powers of darkness, and he has other and
sterner matters to think of.</p>

<p>This machinery of hot-houses, bell-glasses, hospitals, and what
not&mdash;what are we to make of it? I do not think we shall go far wrong in
supposing the hot-house, the bell-glass, the diving-bell, the hospital,
to typify the isolation and insulation caused by a false civilization
and an unreal religion, so productive of hypocrisy, fear, and confusion
that each man is a prisoner within himself, unable to reach his fellow.
And the inmates of the hot-house&mdash;the strange growths, the fantastic
visions, the violent antitheses and incongruities&mdash;these, we may take
it, are the morbidities fostered by a life which protects us and them
from the agencies by which Nature makes her own children perfect in
strength and beauty and service. That is my reading of it; the reader
is perfectly free to differ from me, and will lose little by so doing
if I have succeeded in preserving a tithe of the original beauty of the
verse.</p>

<p>If here and there&mdash;more particularly in the unrhymed pieces&mdash;the
violent and intentional incongruities and antitheses seem startling
and incomprehensible, and a little apt to tickle the risibility of the
frivolous Anglo-Saxon, let us remember that to read a symbolic poem
literally is as foolish as to seek for a cipher in Shakespeare, or to
set about interpreting a melody in terms of its notation, in the hope
of spelling out a message.</p>

<p>One peculiarity of Maeterlinck's which may at first confuse the English
reader is only a simple convention. All poetry is full of similes; the
simile confuses no one. If a poet tells us that his heart is like a
singing-bird we do not seriously suppose him to mean that his heart
has feathers and two legs; but merely that it possesses some other
essential quality of a singing-bird. Now Maeterlinck constantly, in
his verse, uses what is merely a modification of the simile, which has
precisely the same significance, but which takes the form of a positive
assertion of identity. He would say: My heart <i>is</i> a singing-bird
or a plant in a green-house, or anything else that seemed to be
illuminating; and this apparent literalness of statement, which is
carried very far, is, and must always be understood as, a mere variant
of the familiar simile.</p>



<h5>IV</h5>


<p>A word as to the work of translation. Most of the lyrics in <i>Serres
Chaudes</i> are written in the metre familiar to English readers as that
of "In Memoriam." It is, in English, rather a dull metre, the stanza
being in reality no stanza at all, but merely a line of thirty-two
syllables with interior rhymes. It is greatly improved and enlivened
by the omission of four syllables, or rather by their replacement by
pauses of one syllable's value. This change I have sometimes made; and
in one case I have, in order to avoid a verbal obscurity, extended
the line to ten syllables. Apart from these exceptions all the poems
in this volume are translated into their original metres, and it has
always been my first object to produce a literal, almost a word for
word, translation. Whatever the faults of my version, it is strictly
faithful. If I am deemed to have also preserved something of the beauty
of the original I shall feel more than rewarded for a task that has
presented many difficulties.</p>

O Hot-house deep in the forest's heart!<br />
O doors forever sealed!<br />
Lo, all that lives beneath thy dome,<br />
And in my soul, and the likeness of these things!<br />
<br />
The thoughts of a princess who is sick with hunger,<br />
The listless mood of a mariner in the desert,<br />
And brazen music at the windows<br />
Of men who are sick to death!<br />
<br />
Seek out the coolest corners&mdash;<br />
And you think of a woman who has swooned<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">on a day of harvest.</span><br />
<br />
Postilions have entered the courtyard of the hospital,<br />
And there passes yonder an Uhlan, who has turned sick-nurse.<br />
<br />
Behold it all by moonlight!<br />
(Nothing, nothing is in its rightful place!)<br />
And you think of a madwoman haled before the judges,<br />
A warship in full sail on the waters of a canal,<br />
Birds of the night perched among lilies,<br />
And the knell of a passing-bell at the mid-day hour of Angelus.<br />
And yonder&mdash;beneath those domes of glass&mdash;<br />
A group of sick folk halted amid the meadows,<br />
An odour of ether abroad on the sunny air!<br />
<br />
My God, my God, when shall we feel the rain,<br />
And the snow, and the wind, in this close house of glass?<br />

O Pity me that wander hence<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To haunt the threshold of intent</span><br />
My soul is pale with impotence,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Colourless and indolent.</span><br />
<br />
A soul for action all too weak,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pallid with tears, it vainly heeds</span><br />
The weary hands that idly seek<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To grapple with abortive deeds.</span><br />
<br />
Forth from my slumbering heart exhale<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The purple bubbles of its dream;</span><br />
My soul, with waxen hands and frail,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pours forth a drowsy lunar gleam,</span><br />
<br />
A listless light that dimly shows<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The faded lilies of days unborn;</span><br />
A languid light that only throws<br />

Clearer vision to impart:<br />
<br />
Blue as is the house of shade,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Close within whose lofty green</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Casements whose pellucid screen</span><br />
Seems of crystal moonlight made,<br />
<br />
Mighty vegetations rise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose nocturnal shadow deep</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Silent as a charmed sleep</span><br />
Over passion's roses lies;<br />
<br />
Where slow-rising waters gleam,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mingling moon and heaven, and throb</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In one eternal glaucous sob,</span><br />

Green as the sea, temptations creep<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through the shadows of the mind,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where with flaming flowers entwined</span><br />
Dark ejaculations leap&mdash;<br />
<br />
Stems obscure that coil and thrust<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the moon's unhallowed glow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the autumnal shadows throw</span><br />
Of their auguries of lust.<br />
<br />
And the moon may hardly shine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through their fevered fast embrace:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Limb and slimy limb enlace,</span><br />
Emerald and serpentine.<br />
<br />
Sacrilegiously they grow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And their secret will reveal,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dismal as regrets that steal</span><br />
O'er men dying in the snow;<br />
<br />
And their mournful shadows hide<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tangled wounds that mark the thrust</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the azure swords of lust</span><br />
In the crimson flesh of pride.<br />
<br />
When will the dreams of earth, alas,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Find in my heart their final tomb?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O let Thy glory, Lord, illume</span><br />
This dark and evil house of glass,<br />
<br />
And that oblivion nought may win!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The dead leaves of their fevers fall,</span><br />

O Domes of crystal!<br />
O curious plants forever sheltered,<br />
While the wind stirs my senses here without!<br />
A valley of the soul forever undisturbed!<br />
O humid warmth at noon!<br />
O shifting pictures glimpsed in the crystal walls!<br />
<br />
Never lift one of these!<br />
Some have been set upon ancient pools of moonlight.<br />
Peer through the prisoned foliage:<br />
There you may see a beggar upon a throne,<br />
Or maybe pirates, lurking upon a pond,<br />
Or antediluvian beasts about to invade the cities!<br />
<br />
Some have been set on ancient drifts of snow,<br />
And some on pools of rain long fallen.<br />
(O pity the imprisoned air!)<br />
I hear them keeping Carnival on a Sabbath in time of famine;<br />
I see an ambulance in the midst of the fields of harvest,<br />
And all the king's daughters, on a day of fast,<br />
Are wandering through the meadows!<br />
<br />
Mark more especially those on the horizon!<br />
Carefully they cover the tempests of long ago.<br />
Somewhere, I think, you will see a great armada, sailing across a swamp!<br />
And there the brooding swans have hatched a nest of crows!<br />
(It is hard to see through the veil of moisture.)<br />
And a maiden is watering the heath with steaming water,<br />
A troop of little girls is watching the hermit in his cell,<br />
And I see my sisters asleep in the depth of a poisonous cavern!<br />
<br />
Wait until the moonlight, wait until the winter<br />
Shall cover these domes of crystal set amid ice and snow!<br />

The dark brings visions to mine eyes:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thro' my desires they seek their goal.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O nights within the humid soul,</span><br />
O heart to dreams that open lies!<br />
<br />
With azure reveries I bedew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The roses of attempts undone;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My lashes close the gates upon</span><br />
The longings that will ne'er come true.<br />
<br />
My pallid indolent fingers plant<br />
Ever in vain, at close of day,<br />
The emerald bells of hope that lay<br />
Over the purple leaves of want.<br />
<br />
Helpless, my soul beholds with dread<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The bitter musings of my lips,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Amid the crowding lily-tips:</span><br />
O that this wavering heart were dead<br />

<br />
My soul!<br />
O, my soul, verily too closely sheltered!<br />
And the flocks of my desires, imprisoned in a house of glass!<br />
Waiting until the tempest break upon the meadows!<br />
<br />
Come first of all to these, so sick and fragile:<br />
From these a strange effluvium rises.<br />
And lo, it seems I am with my mother,<br />
Crossing a field of battle.<br />
They are burying a brother-in-arms at noon,<br />
While the sentinels are snatching a meal.<br />
<br />
Now let us go to the feeblest:<br />
These are covered with a strange sweat.<br />
Here is an ailing bride,<br />
And an act of treachery done upon a Sabbath,<br />
And little children in prison,<br />
And yonder, yonder through the mist,<br />
Do I see there a woman dying at the door of a kitchen,<br />
Or a Sister of Charity, shelling peas at the bedside of a dying patient?<br />
<br />
Last of all let us go to the saddest:<br />
(Last of all, for these are venom'd.)<br />
O, my lips are pressed by the kisses of a wounded man!<br />
<br />
In the castles of my soul this summer all the<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">chatelaines have died of hunger!</span><br />
<br />
Now it is twilight on the morning of a day of festival!<br />
I catch a glimpse of sheep along the quays,<br />
And there is a sail by the windows of the hospital.<br />
<br />
The road is long from my heart to my soul,<br />
And all the sentinels have died at their posts!<br />
One day there was a poor little festival in the suburbs of my soul!<br />
They were mowing the hemlock there one Sunday morning,<br />
And all the maiden women of the convent<br />
were watching the passing vessels,<br />
On the canal, one sunny fast-day.<br />
But the swans were ailing, in the shadow of the rotting bridge.<br />
They were lopping the trees about the prison,<br />
They were bringing remedies, on an afternoon of June,<br />
And on every hand there were sick folk feasting!<br />
<br />
Alas, my soul,<br />
<br />
And alas, the sadness of all these things!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><a id="LASSITUDE"></a>LASSITUDE</span><br />
<br />
<br />
These lips have long forgotten to bestow<br />
Their kiss on blind eyes chiller than the snow,<br />
Henceforth absorbed in their magnificent dream.<br />
Drowsy as hounds deep in the grass they seem;<br />
They watch the grey flocks on the sky-line pass,<br />
Browsing on moonlight scattered o'er the grass,<br />
By skies as vague as their own life caressed.<br />
They see, unvexed by envy or unrest,<br />
The roses of joy that open on every hand,<br />
The long green peace they cannot understand.<br />

Thro' the leaves the woods have shed,<br />
<br />
My sins like yellow mongrels slink;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Uncouth hyænas, my hates complain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And on the pale and listless plain</span><br />
Couching low, love's lions blink.<br />
<br />
Powerless, deep in a dream of peace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sunk in a languid spell they lie,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Under a colourless desolate sky,</span><br />
There they gaze and never cease,<br />
<br />
Where like sheep temptations graze,<br />

Pity the trespass of my mouth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And things undone, and words unsaid;</span><br />
Shed lilies on my fever's drouth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And roses on the marshes shed!</span><br />

The birds that fly away before my slumber break;<br />
Proud, indifferent, slow, the white birds of To-day,<br />
Winning with indolent flight the shores of the sunless lake;<br />

The hospital, and the month July!<br />
They are lighting a fire in the ward,<br />
While the Atlantic steamers are whistling on the canal!<br />
<br />
(Do not go near the windows!)<br />
Here are emigrants loitering through a palace,<br />
And I see a yacht in a tempest!<br />
And herds of cattle on all the ships!<br />
<br />
(It is better to keep the windows fastened;<br />
Then we are all but safe from the outside world!)<br />
<br />
One thinks of a forcing-frame placed upon a snow-drift,<br />
Or a woman being churched on a day of thunder;<br />
One catches a glimpse of plants scattered over a blanket,<br />
And a conflagration on a sunny day,<br />
And I pass through a forest full of wounded men....<br />
<br />
O, here at last is the moonlight!<br />
<br />
A fountain is playing in the middle of the ward!<br />
And a troop of little girls has opened the door!<br />
And lo, a glimpse of lambs in an isle of meadows!<br />
And beautiful plants on a glacier!<br />
And lilies in a hall of marble!<br />
There is a banquet in a virgin forest,<br />
And the vegetation of the tropics in a cavern of ice!<br />
<br />
Listen! They are opening the locks,<br />
And the ocean steamers are churning the waters of the canal!<br />
<br />
But see, the Sister of Charity is making up the fire!<br />
<br />
All the lovely green rushes of the banks are in flames!<br />
And a boat full of wounded men is tossing in the moonlight!<br />
All the king's daughters are out in a boat in the storm!<br />
And the princesses are dying in a field of hemlock!<br />
<br />
Oh, do not unfasten the windows!<br />
Listen&mdash;the ocean steamers are still hooting on the horizon!<br />
<br />
They are poisoning someone in a garden!<br />
They are holding a splendid festival in the houses of the enemy!<br />
There are deer in a beleaguered city!<br />
And a menagerie in a garden of lilies!<br />
And the jungle of the tropics in the depths of a coal-mine!<br />
A flock of sheep is crossing an iron bridge!<br />
And the lambs have come from the meadows and are mournfully<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">entering the ward!</span><br />
<br />
Now the Sister of Charity is lighting the lamps;<br />
Now she is bringing the patients their supper,<br />

Lust with lust is warring there.<br />
<br />
Thro' the lassitude of dreams<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shines the moon as thro' a mesh;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the wandering joy of flesh</span><br />
Still on pestilent beaches gleams.<br />
<br />
Under ever-shrouded skies,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thirsting for their starry fires,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thro' my veins I hear desires</span><br />
Toward the green horizon rise.<br />
<br />
Evil fondnesses I hear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Blackly surging through my mind:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Phantom marshes vanish blind</span><br />
Sudden on the sky-line drear.<br />
<br />
O Lord, thy wrath will slay me soon!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Have pity on me, Lord, I pray!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sweating and sick, O let me stray</span><br />
Thro' pastures glimmering in the moon!<br />
<br />
For now, O Lord, the time is nigh<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To rase the hemlock with the steel,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose moon my secret hopes reveal</span><br />
Green as a serpent in the sky:<br />
<br />
And the plague of dreams mine eyes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Smites, and all its sins subdue,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the rustling fountains blue</span><br />

<br />
Always rain on the far sky-line;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Always snow on the beaches gleams,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While by the bolted gate of dreams</span><br />
Crouching wolves in the grasses whine.<br />
<br />
Into my listless soul I gaze:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With clouded eyes I search the past,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At all the long-spilt blood aghast</span><br />

The nuptials of the sick are held.<br />
<br />
Voices thro' my slumber sound:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Listlessly they gather near.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lilies bloom in closes where</span><br />
Star nor sun hath blessed the ground.<br />

And lo, these ghosts of old desire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">These lagging throbs of impulse crost,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are paupers in a palace lost,</span><br />
Sick tapers in the auroral fire.<br />
<br />
When shall the moon my vision bathe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That seeks to plume the eternal streams</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of darkness, and about my dreams</span><br />

<br />
I wait&mdash;at length to feel its cooling wind<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Strike on my heart, impregnable to lies,</span><br />
A paschal lamb lost amid marshes blind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A wound o'er which the surging waters rise.</span><br />

I wait&mdash;for nights no morrow shall defy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I wait&mdash;for weakness nothing shall avail;</span><br />
To feel upon my hands its shadow lie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To see in peaceful tides its image pale.</span><br />

I wait until those nights of thine shall show<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All my desires with cleansed eyes go by,</span><br />

whales that are voyaging to the Pole!<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">laden with ice:</span><br />
A glacier was there, in the midst of the July meadows!<br />
And men are swimming and floating in the<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">green waters of the creek,</span><br />
And at noon they enter shadowy caverns...<br />
And the breezes of ocean are fanning the roofs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">and balconies.</span><br />
<br />
Lo, the flaming tongues of the Gulf-Stream!<br />
Take heed lest their kisses touch the walls of<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">lassitude!</span><br />
They have ceased to lay ice on the brows of<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">the fevered,</span><br />
And the patients have lit a bonfire<br />
And are casting great handfuls of green lilies<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">into the flames!</span><br />
<br />
Lean your brows upon the cooler panes,<br />
While waiting for the moonlight to enter the<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">bell from above,</span><br />
And close your eyes tightly, to the forest of colour,<br />
The pendulous blues and albuminous violets,<br />
And close your ears to the suggestions of the<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">tepid water.</span><br />
<br />
Dry the brows of your desires; they are weak<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">with sweat.</span><br />
Go firstly to those on the point of swooning.<br />
They have the air of people celebrating a<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">wedding in a dungeon,</span><br />
Or of people entering, at mid-day, a long lamp-lit<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">avenue underground;</span><br />
In festival procession they are passing<br />
Thro' a landscape like an orphaned childhood.<br />
<br />
Go now to those about to die:<br />
They move like virgins who have wandered far<br />
In the sun, on a day of fast;<br />
They are pale as patients who placidly listen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">to the rain in the gardens of the hospital;</span><br />
They have the look of survivors, breaking their<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">fast on a battle-field;</span><br />
They are like prisoners who know that all their<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">gaolers are bathing in the river,</span><br />

garden of the prison.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">See thro' the lids that slumber closes</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Crows that gather amid the roses,</span><br />
Sick folk under a sunbright sky.<br />
<br />
Of these vague loves the weary smart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shines unchanging late and soon</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like a pale slow-moving moon</span><br />

Thou know'st, O Lord, my spirit's dearth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou see'st the worth of what I bring</span><br />
The evil blossoms of the earth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The light upon a perished thing.</span><br />
<br />
Thou see'st my sick and weary mood:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The moon is dark, the dawn is slain.</span><br />
Thy glory on my solitude<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shed Thou like fructifying rain.</span><br />
<br />
Light Thou, O Lord, beneath my feet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The way my weary soul should pass,</span><br />
For now the pain of all things sweet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is piteous as the ice-bound grass.</span><br />

O all these poor weary glances!<br />
And yours, and mine!<br />
And those that are no more, and those to be!<br />
And those that will never be, and yet exist!<br />
There are those that seem to visit the poor on a Sabbath;<br />
There are some like sick folk who are houseless,<br />
There are some like lambs in a meadow full of bleaching linen;<br />
And O, these strange unwonted glances!<br />
Under the vaults of some we behold<br />
A maiden being put to death in a chamber with closed doors.<br />
And some make us dream of unknown sorrows,<br />
<br />
Of peasants at the windows of a factory,<br />
Of a gardener turned weaver,<br />
Of a summer afternoon in a wax-work show,<br />
Of the thoughts of a queen on beholding sick man in a garden,<br />
Of an odour of camphor in the forest,<br />
Of a princess locked in a tower on a day of rejoicing,<br />
Of men sailing all the week on the stagnant waters of a canal.<br />
<br />
Have pity on those that come creeping forth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">like convalescents at harvest-tide!</span><br />
Have pity on those that have the air of children<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">who have lost their way at supper-time!</span><br />
Have pity on the glances of the wounded man at the surgeon,<br />
Like tents stricken by a hurricane!<br />
Have pity on the glances of the virgin tempted!<br />
(Rivers of milk are flowing away in the darkness;<br />
And the swans have died in the midst of serpents!)<br />
And the gaze of the virgin who surrenders!<br />
<br />
There are princesses deserted in swamps that have no issue!<br />
And lo, those eyes in which you may see ships<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">in full sail, lit up by flashes of the storm!</span><br />
And how pitiful are all those glances which<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">suffer because they are not elsewhere!</span><br />
And so much suffering, so indistinguishable<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">and yet so various!</span><br />
And those glances which no one will ever understand!<br />
And those poor glances which are all but dumb!<br />
And those poor whispering glances!<br />
And those poor stifled glances!<br />
<br />
Amid some of these you might think yourself<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">in a mansion serving as hospital,</span><br />
And many others have the air of tents, lilies of war,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">on the little lawn of the convent!</span><br />
And many others have the air of wounded men<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">tended in a hot-house!</span><br />
Or Sisters of Charity on an ocean devoid of patients!<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, to have encountered all these glances,<br />
To have admitted them all,<br />
And to have exhausted mine thereby!<br />
And henceforth to be unable to close mine eyes!<br />

Lord, my broken dreams complete,<br />
That Thine angels' lips repeat.<br />

She breathes the prayers that in her rise&mdash;<br />
Prayers that find my lids a tomb,<br />

<br />
The sun upon my pillow plays,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The self-same hours they sound again,</span><br />
And always falls my questing gaze<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On dying men that harvest grain.</span><br />
<br />
My hands they pluck the withered grass,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mine eyes with sleep are all undone,</span><br />
Are sick folk in a springless pass,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or flowers of darkness in the sun.</span><br />
<br />
When will my dreams unchanging know<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The rain, and when the meadows brown</span><br />
Along the far horizon, lo,<br />

Houses of the listless soul!<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><a id="CONTACTS"></a>CONTACTS</span><br />
<br />
<br />
The sense of contact!<br />
Darkness lies between your fingers!<br />
The cries of brazen instruments in a tempest!<br />
The music of organs in the sunlight!<br />
All the flocks of the soul in the depths of a night of eclipse!<br />
All the salt of the sea on the grass of the meadows!<br />
And the blaze of blue lightning on every horizon!<br />
(Have pity on this human sense!)<br />
<br />
But O these sadder, wearier contacts!<br />
O the touch of your poor moist hands!<br />
I hear your pure fingers as they glide between mine,<br />
And flocks of lambs are departing by moonlight<br />
Along the banks of a misty river.<br />
<br />
I can remember all the hands that have touched my hands,<br />
And again I see all that was protected by those hands,<br />
And I see to-day what I was, protected by those cool hands.<br />
I was often the beggar who gnaws his crust<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">on the steps of a throne.</span><br />
<br />
I was sometimes the diver, who cannot evade the surging waters.<br />
I was often a whole people, no longer able to escape from the town!<br />
And some hands were like a convent without a garden!<br />
And some confined me like a group of invalids in a glass-house<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">on a rainy day!</span><br />
Until other cooler hands should come to set the doors ajar,<br />
And sprinkle a little water upon the threshold!<br />
<br />
<br />
O, I have known strange contacts,<br />
And here they surround me forever!<br />
Some were wont to give alms on a day of sun-shine,<br />
Some gathered a harvest in the depths of a cavern,<br />
And the music of mountebanks was heard outside the prison.<br />
There were wax-work figures in the summer woods,<br />
And elsewhere the moon had swept the whole oasis,<br />
And at times I found a virgin, flushed and sweating,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">in a grotto of ice!</span><br />
<br />
Pity these strange hands!<br />
These hands contain the secrets of all the kings!<br />
Pity these hands too pale!<br />
They seem to have emerged from the caverns of the moon;<br />
They are worn with spinning threads from the<br />
distaffs of fountains!<br />
Pity these hands, too white, too moist!<br />
They are like princesses that slumber at noon<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">all the summer through.</span><br />
<br />
Avoid these hard harsh hands!<br />
They seem to have issued from the rocks!<br />
But pity these cold hands!<br />
I see a heart bleeding under ribs of ice!<br />
And pity these evil hands,<br />
For these have poisoned the springs!<br />
They have set young cygnets in a nest of hemlock!<br />
I have seen the angels of evil open the gates at noon!<br />
Here are only madmen on a pestilent river!<br />
Here are black sheep only in starless pastures!<br />
And lambs hasting away to graze in darkness!<br />
<br />
But O these cool faithful hands!<br />
They come to offer ripe fruits to the dying!<br />
They bring clear cold water in their palms!<br />
They water the battlefields with milk!<br />
They have surely come from wonderful and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">eternally virgin forests!</span><br />

Sick and sad, being weary too,<br />
Weary of being so vain, so vain,<br />
Weary and sad at the end of all,<br />
And O I long for the touch of you!<br />
<br />
I long for your hands upon my face;<br />
Snow-cold as spirits they will be;<br />
I wait until they bring the ring.<br />
I wait for their coolness over my face<br />
Like a treasure deep in the sea.<br />
<br />
I wait to know their healing spell,<br />
Lest in the desolate sun I die,<br />
So that I die not out in the sun;<br />
O bathe mine eyes and make them well,<br />
Where things unhappy slumbering lie.<br />
<br />
Where many swans upon the sea,<br />
Swans that wander over the sea,<br />
Stretch forth their mournful throats in vain<br />
In wintry gardens by the sea<br />
Sick men pluck roses in their pain.<br />
<br />
I long for your hands upon my face;<br />
Snow-cold as spirits they will be,<br />
And soothe my aching sight, alas!<br />
My vision like the withered grass<br />
Where listless lambs irresolute pass!<br />

She chained her in a cavern frore.<br />
She set a sign upon the door.<br />
The key into the ocean fell:<br />
The maid forgot the lamp as well.<br />
<br />
She waited for the days of spring;<br />
Year by year did seven die,<br />
And every year one passed her by.<br />
<br />
She waited thro' the winter's cold,<br />
And her tresses, waiting too,<br />
Recalled the light that once they knew.<br />
<br />
They sought the light, they found it out,<br />
Crept thro' the rocks and round about,<br />
And lit the rocks with all their gold.<br />
<br />
He comes at eve that passed of old:<br />
Amazéd at the wondrous sight<br />
He does not dare approach the light.<br />

Or angels at their sport divine:<br />

To see what hid within their hearts.<br />

The first little heart was full of bliss,<br />
And lo, wherever its blood might run,<br />
Three serpents hissed till three years were done.<br />
<br />
The second was full of gentlehood,<br />
And lo, wherever its blood might run<br />
Three lambs that fed till three years were done.<br />

The third was full of pain and woe,<br />
And lo, wherever the red blood crept<br />
Archangels three their vigil kept.<br />

And forth to seek their death they're gone.<br />
<br />
They wander to the forest forth:<br />
"Give us our death, O forest old,<br />
For here are our three crowns of gold."<br />
<br />
The forest broke into a smile,<br />
And kisses gave to each twice twain,<br />
That showed them all the future plain.<br />
<br />
There were three sisters fain to die:<br />
They wandered forth to seek the sea:<br />
They found it after summers three.<br />
<br />
"Give us our death, thou ocean old,<br />
For here are our three crowns of gold."<br />
Then the ocean began to weep:<br />
<br />
Three hundred kisses it gave the three,<br />
And all the past was plain to see.<br />
There were three sisters fain to die,<br />
<br />
To find the city they sought awhile;<br />
They found it midmost of an isle.<br />
<br />
"Give us our death, thou city old,<br />
For here are our three crowns of gold."<br />
<br />
The city opened then and there,<br />
And covered them with kisses dear<br />
That showed them all the present clear.<br />

Canticle of the Virgin in "Sister Beatrice"<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><br />
<br />
I hold, to every sin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To every soul that weeps,</span><br />
My hands with pardon filled<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Out of the starry deeps.</span><br />
<br />
There is no sin that lives<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When love hath vigil kept;</span><br />
There is no soul that mourns<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When love but once hath wept.</span><br />
<br />
And tho' on many paths<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of earth love lose its way,</span><br />
Its tears will find me out<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shall not go astray.</span><br />
